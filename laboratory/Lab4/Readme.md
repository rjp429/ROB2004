# Laboratory 3: Inverse Kinematics and Trajectory Generation

Welcome to the third laboratory of the semester. 

## Goals
The goals of the laboratory are
1. learn how to compute analytic inverse kinematic solutions for simple kinematic chains
2. learn how to generate smooth trajectories to go from an initial position to a goal position
3. implement your first inverse kinematics algorithm
4. implement your first trajectory generation algorithm
4. use both algorithms to implement a reaching controller


## Pre-requisites
In order to do the laboratory you will need to have installed on your machine:
* Python 3
* numpy, matplotlib 
* pybullet


## TODO
Complete the [Inverse Kinematics notebook](Inverse_Kinematics.ipynb)
