    "Last laboratory, we used the inverse of the Jacobian to control the foot position and move it in arbitrary directions.\n",
    "We were inverting the relationship $\\dot{p}_{foot} = J \\dot{\\theta}$ to compute the desired velocity of the joint given a desired velocity of the foot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory, we will revisit direct control of the foot, this time using the relationship $\\tau = J^T F_{foot}$, where $\\tau$ is the vector of motor torques and $F_{foot}$ the 3D force at the end-effector.\n",
    "For a desired force $F_{pos}$, we can directly compute the required motor torques $\\tau$ without the need to compute\n",
    "any inverse. We will use this relationship to move the foot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we want the foot to behave as if springs and dampers were attached to it, as shown in this figure\n",
    "![](./spring_schematics.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the $x$ direction. An ideal spring will have a stiffness $K_x$ and a rest position $x_0$. Therefore, we should see a force pushing or pulling the foot according to $F_x = K_x (x_0 - x_{measured})$, where $x_{measured}$ is the measured position of the foot (make sure that $x_0$ and $x_{measured}$ are expressed in the same coordinate frame!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 3D, setting the rest position to $p_0 = [x_0, y_0, z_0]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, we will have a force $$F = K (p_0 - p_{measured})$$\n",
    "where where $p_{measured}$ is the measured position of the foot in 3D and $K$ is a diagonal gain matrix that contains the stiffnesses of the 3 springs one its diagonal, i.e. \n",
    "$$K = \\begin{bmatrix} K_x & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & K_y & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & K_z \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this behavior, one can simply set the torques on the motors of the robot as\n",
    "$$ \\tau = J_{Ov}^T K (p_0 - p_{measured})$$ The leg will then behave like a spring.\n",
    "Note here that we are only using the bottom three rows of the Jacobian, as we are only interested in the force and not the moments (which we ignore).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to a spring, it is often a good idea to have a damper, that will dampen out any oscillations of the spring such that the leg can reach its rest position $p_0$ (otherwise it would oscillate forever). We can then also add a force conteracting velocity of the foot as\n",
    "$-D \\dot{p}_{measured}$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix that contains the damping gains for each spring.\n",

    "## Questions\n",
    "1. Write an impedance controller with a constant stiffness $K_x = K_z = 50$ and $K_y = 10$ and with damping only in the x,z direction ($D_x = D_z = 5$, $D_y = 0$) so the vertical direction will behave like a ideal spring.\n",
    "Set $p_0 = [0.3, -0.2, 0.014]$. Plot the position of the end-effector and its velocity as a function of time. Does it behave as expected? (make sure you start the robot with initial configuration $q=[0,0,0]$).\n",
    "2. Redo the same experiment when adding damping in the y direction $D_y = .1$ and then again with $D_y = 1$. Plot again the end-effector positions and velocities, what do you notice different? (make sure you start the robot with initial configuration $q=[0,0,0]$).\n",
    "3. Write an impedance controller that can draw a circle in the x-y plane. We would like to follow the 3D foot trajectory $$x_{ref}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.3 + 0.05\\cos(\\omega t) \\\\ -0.2 + 0.05 \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "where $\\omega = \\pi$ is the frequency of rotation around the circle (frequency of rotation of $0.5Hz$).\n",
    "Use $K = \\text{Diag}([50,50,50])$ and $D = \\text{Diag}([5,5,5])$. Plot the desired and measured positions of the foot as well as the desired and measured velocities of the foot. Compare your results with what you did in Lab5. What are the pros and cons of both methods?\n",
    "4. (Optional) Test the controller(s) on the real robot and plot the same plots as for the simulation"
