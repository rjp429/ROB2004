    "## Getting the robot to jump\n",

    "We now allow the robot to move along the y axis (as if it was attached on a rail such that it cannot move in any other direction). But the robot can fall on the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "1. Write an impedance controller with desired set point $p_0 = [0.3,-0.2,0.014]$, stiffness $K = [300,300,300]$ and damping $D = [5, .1, 5]$. Run the simulation from the beginning (when the robot is dropped from above). What do you observe? Is it what you would expect? How is the motion of the robot changing when you change the stiffness in the y direction? and the damping?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use a time varying setpoint for the vertical (y) direction, such that $y_{ref} = -0.2 + 0.1\\sin(\\omega t)$, with $\\omega = 2\\pi$. What is the behavior of the robot that you observe? (plot the position and velocity of the foot vs. the desired position). In these experiments, use $D = [5, .1, 5]$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Change the amplitude of the sine wave and its frequency and try to get parameters to jump as high as possible. What parameters did you find? What else could you do to get the robot to jump higher? (only describe what you think would help - assuming that you can do anything you like with the robot).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. (optional) Try to do the same motion of the foot with the velocity-based controller you wrote in Lab5. What do you observe? In your opinion, why are the behaviors different?"
