    "# Typical control loops with sensors and actuators\n",

    "We have seen in the previous notebook how to do simple simulation and record the state of the joints of the robot (position and velocity). We discuss here how we can make the robot move by sending motor commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every robot comes with a set of actuators that need to be controlled. Typically, a set of \"low-level\" controllers are available such that one can send a desired motor torque or a desired joint position and the robot controller will transform this into a current to modulate the rotation of an electric motor or the opening/closing of a pneumatic or hydraulic valve. This in turn will create a movement of the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our class, we will assume that we can send a desired joint torque and that it will be achieved on the robot. PyBullet enables the same level of \"abstraction\" which is sufficient for most robot applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now see how we can send desired motor torques to the robot. We have wrapped all the functionality needed from PyBullet into the class NYUFingerSimulator located in the file [nyu_finger_simulator.py](./nyu_finger_simulator.py)."
